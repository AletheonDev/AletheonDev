## GET TO KNOW ME PLEASE !
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m ADVRL a self-taught developer ( WEB DEVELOPER AT THE MOMENT ) with a little bit of a university background but i left it because of a trauma i had.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning kotlin and android development but i also have a little background in Java which i studied in university.
- ðŸ¥° I just love learning especially with some books or a well-structured youtube video series, a little less with websites or apps but i am trying to do that also.
